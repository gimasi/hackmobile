# Sensors
Luckily there are already a hand full of sensor provided on the calliope board itself. On the board itself are
* 5x5 LED Matrix, RGB-LED
* Buttons, Speakers and Microphone
* Environment-Sensors: Motion, acceleration, temperature, and ambient light sensors, compass
* Bluetooth and the seperate NB-IoT-Module

More information can be found in the calliope docu [here](calliope.md#the-iot-board-contains-the-following-components) and [here](https://calliope.cc/en/ueber-mini)

# Additional Sensors
We also order a few extra sensor for the event. A list and all needed informations can be found [here](https://github.com/ubirch/telekom-nbiot-hackathon-2017/blob/master/sensors.md).  

Please note: There is only a limited amount of the additional sensors available. In reason of that we can only provided a sensor or two per team and not to each developer.

# Are you a Maker?
If you are a Maker and already missed the oppurtunity to solder a prototype something by yourself. We also just ordered solder iron, jump wires, tape, leds and more. Feel free to get our hands on with the stuff in the maker area.
